In easy setting, you should have no trouble winning. Medium should provide a real challenge. Hard should be really tough.\n- Extended sound effects and score.\n- Choice of violent and fairly non-violent gameplay options \n\nAs the first teams taking it on, you will be sort of a beta tester. Scenario should be good to go after some alpha testing, but it can always be better.\n\nAs the scenario is fairly long, use 'save' option and take photographs of your gameboard to resume at later time.\n\nKown Issues (any help in fixing them is welcome):\n- Outdoor sight markers not removed properly.\n\n--------------------------------------\n\nRecent Changes:\n1.0 Initial release\n1.1 Spell check (thanks to Matthew), issue fixes, made EASY easier
