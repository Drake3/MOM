Majority finishes in around 4h.\n\nKown Issues (any help in fixing them is welcome):\n- Outdoor sight markers not removed properly.\n--------------------------------------\nRecent Changes:\n1.1 Spell check (thanks to Matthew), issue fixes, made EASY easier\n1.2/1.3 Walkthrough adjusted.\n1.4 More barrel options, bug fixes.\n1.5 Gaming Time adjusted, added clarifying texts, made Riot easier.
